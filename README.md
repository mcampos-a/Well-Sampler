## Optimizations:

This application is at mvp stage. With more time I want to add a data graphing library to display graphs, trends, and dashboards of data collected. 

## Lessons Learned:

This was a fun project to put together. My knowledge of data collection and field work during well excavation and well sampling demanded I build a tool for hydrologists to decrease the amount of time from gathering data to building a report of that data. I put into practice an MVC architecture that allowed me to seamlessly keep adding functionality to this app.
